FAQ
======

Why do you need another one?

Just for fun.

Why is it better than any other?

Because WPF UI itself is rendered in hardware awesomeness, so it just looks better!

When can I use it for good?

I have no idea. I need it for myself, so I hope it will be done before my two HDDs fail with all my archive on them.



* NOTE: If you feel adventurous check out the development branch. No promises on stability, or AWS bills.
